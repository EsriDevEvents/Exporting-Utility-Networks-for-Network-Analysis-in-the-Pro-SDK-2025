## Esri Dev & Tech Summit Demo 2025: ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET Exporting Utility Networks for Network Analysis in the Pro SDK

This sample demonstrates the APIs that can be used to export trace data and subnetwork information into JSON files. 
These files may include network attributes, feature attributes, as well as connectivity and containment information.

After exporting, the JSON file is parsed and analyzed to extract information regarding barriers, controllers, features, 
associations, and connectivity. Furthermore, the connectivity information can be used to create a network graph for additional network analysis.
